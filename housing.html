      New York’s buildings can be categorized by building height, construction 
      type (as defined by the Building Code), and proximity to other structures.
      Building height ranges from low-rise (1 or 2 floors) to mid-rise (3 to 6 floors) 
      to high-rise (7 floors and up). Meanwhile, there are two main construction 
      types: so-called “combustible” buildings that are built using lighter 
      stud-frame construction or wood joists on masonry bearing walls; and 
      “non-combustible” buildings that use steel or masonry and concrete frames.
      Buildings in New York also can be characterized by their proximity to each
      other: they can be detached (freestanding); semi-attached (sharing a wall 
      with another building); or attached (sharing walls on at least two sides 
      with adjoining buildings).
