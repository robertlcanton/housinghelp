        " my blood pressure was through the roof at the doctors office. I got 
        form anxiety because they made my fill out my patient information form" 

        “Somebody may avoid or be phobic of completing a form because they’re  
        afraid that they’ll be overwhelmed by the process, [or it] may be 
        revealed they’ve done something that’s improper and they may be afraid 
        of the consequences. “So they manage it by avoidance.”
